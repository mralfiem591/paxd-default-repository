Our switch to YAML-first

paxd-sdk will be switching to a YAML-first install method. This means that your base "paxd" file will no longer be available. We will be serving a "package.yaml" instead.

Why?
It makes it easier for us to maintain, as we can read a YAML file easier than a JSONC file.

Will this change anything for me?
As long as you are on a newer version of PaxD, no. PaxD has been transitioning to YAML-first already, and already contains code ported over from paxd-compiler (com.mralfiem591.paxd).
If you are on a version new enough to display this message during installation, you are on a version new enough to support YAML.
If you are on an older version, paxd-imageview will now become unavailable for you to use. Please update to a later version to keep using PaxD, via `paxd update -f paxd`.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
