Major vulnerability fix

A major vulnerability was fixed in the PaxD SDK. This could allow for ACE (Arbitrary Code Execution) via package names with malicious characters. All package management functions now sanitize package names to prevent this issue.

This vulnerability is rated as EXTREME (8.1/10) due to the potential for severe damage if exploited.

Please update to the latest version of the PaxD SDK to ensure your system's security.

For example, an attacker could have a script with the following in it:

```python
SDK.Package.Install("com.mralfiem591.paxd-sdk && rm -rf /important/data")
```
This would execute the `rm -rf /important/data` command after installing the package, potentially deleting important data.

This would execute the following exact command:

```bash
start cmd /c paxd install --skip-checksum com.mralfiem591.paxd-sdk && rm -rf /important/data
```

Please ensure you update to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability.
You can find more information on the GitHub issue being released soon for PAXD-2025-0003.

All SDK endpoints for package management have been updated to sanitize package names by removing potentially dangerous characters such as `/`, `\`, `..`, `&`, `;`, and `|`, which should NEVER be in a package name.

The following versions are affected:
- PaxD SDK v1.0.0 to v1.0.4
- PaxD SDK v1.1.0 to v1.1.4
- PaxD SDK v1.2.0 to v1.2.1
And any others below v1.2.1.

Thank you for your attention to this important security update.

NEVER download packages from unknown locations or sources outside of the official PaxD repository you do not trust.
