// Example package for new PaxD package developers. There will be comments in it explaining each part.

// You can view an example of the new YAML based PaxD package format by changing "paxd-example" to "paxd.yaml" in the URL.
// It is recommened you read and understand this before reading YAML, as it has little to no comments (as it is mostly the same as this).
