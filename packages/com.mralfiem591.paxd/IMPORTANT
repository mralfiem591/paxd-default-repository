Many PaxD packages have been switching to a YAML-first system, and while this is good, the main PaxD package will be sticking to serving a PaxD file, now just compiled via a YAML file.

This gets us the benifits of using a YAML file, without breaking other scripts and the main installer, of which are built for paxd files.

This will make no difference to your daily usage.

Thanks for taking the (probably short) amount of time to read this.
