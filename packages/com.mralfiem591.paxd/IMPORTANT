JSONC manifests have been phased out in favor of YAML-based manifests.
They are retained here solely to facilitate updates from older versions of PaxD that may still rely on JSONC manifests.

Please, if you are making a package, **use YAML manifests** as documented.

This will make no difference to users, as PaxD supports both formats seamlessly.

Thank you for your understanding!
