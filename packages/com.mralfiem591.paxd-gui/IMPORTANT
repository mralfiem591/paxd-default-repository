PaxD GUI versions 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 have major flaws, that can prevent startup in some enviroments.

Please upgrade to version 1.1.9 or later, via the command `paxd update paxd-gui`.

You may notice errors relating to "main thread not in main loop" or FileNotFound/WinError 2. These can result in a range of issues, some of which known are:
- Immediate GUI crash - 1.1.7 only
- Empty package list - both versions affected
- GUI crashing, starting back up, and crashing again - 1.1.7 only
- Error popup, and no GUI - 1.1.8 only

Please update ASAP to the patched version(s) - 1.1.9 or later - to avoid these issues.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
You may notice an empty package list upon first run after installation of version 1.1.9. A fix should now be released in 1.1.10.

# IMPORTANT NOTE 2
If you are using a GUI version equal to or later than 1.1.13, and PaxD version 26.0.13 or earlier, you will not be able to use the GUI. You will experience an "Incorrect Launch Method" crash at startup. Please update PaxD to version 26.0.14 or later to resolve this issue.
