PaxD GUI versions 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 have major flaws, that can prevent startup in some enviroments.

Please upgrade to version 1.1.9 or later, via the command `paxd update paxd-gui`.

You may notice errors relating to "main thread not in main loop" or FileNotFound/WinError 2. These can result in a range of issues, some of which known are:
- Immediate GUI crash - 1.1.7 only
- Empty package list - both versions affected
- GUI crashing, starting back up, and crashing again - 1.1.7 only
- Error popup, and no GUI - 1.1.8 only

Please update ASAP to the patched version(s) - 1.1.9 or later - to avoid these issues.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
You may notice an empty package list upon first run after installation of version 1.1.9 or later. We are looking into this issue, and hope to have a fix out soon. In the meantime, please restart the GUI once, or press the "Refresh" button located at the top-right of the package list, to load the packages correctly. This only occurs once.
