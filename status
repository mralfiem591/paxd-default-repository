We are currently experiencing an issue related to checksum verification during installation or updating, and we are currently looking into it. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as we work to resolve the problem. Please stay tuned for updates.

If you experience a checksum issue, try rerunning with the -sk flag to skip checksum verification as a temporary workaround.

Thanks for your understanding!
